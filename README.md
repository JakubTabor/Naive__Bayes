# Naive__Bayes
# I have "X" and "y" prepared, so I can import "train_test_split" and get "train" "test" set
# Then I make "feature scaling", so I import "StandardScaler" and prepare "X_train" """X_train  = sc.fit_transform(X_train)""" 
# And "X_test """X_test = sc.transform(X_test)"""
# Next from "sklearn.naive_bayes" import "GaussianNB" and train my classifier """classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)"""
